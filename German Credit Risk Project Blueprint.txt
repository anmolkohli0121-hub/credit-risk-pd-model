Perfect. This will now become your **official fixed project blueprint**.
We will **never deviate from this again**. Save this.

This is aligned with:

* Your **FRM + risk career**
* Your **₹20L+ analyst goal**
* Your **INSEAD + hedge fund + OpenAI roadmap**
* Your flagship **GitHub portfolio**

# 🔥 FINAL BLUEPRINT – German Credit Risk PD Project

From start → SQL → Tableau/PowerBI
(Industry + quant + risk standard)

---

## 🧠 OVERALL STRUCTURE

We are building **3 layers**:

1. **Data science layer (Python)**
2. **Risk + business layer (SQL)**
3. **Executive layer (Dashboard)**

This is exactly how real banks and hedge funds work.

# 🚀 PHASE 0 – PROJECT SETUP

## ✅ Step 0.1 – Folder Structure

```
German_Credit_Risk/
│
├── data/
├── notebooks/
├── src/
├── outputs/
├── dashboard/
├── sql/
├── README.md
```

---

## ✅ Step 0.2 – GitHub Setup

Create repo and push initial structure.

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 0 – Project initialized`

---

---

# 🚀 PHASE 1 – DATA CLEANING & FEATURE ENGINEERING (Python)

Notebook:

```
01_data_cleaning.ipynb
```

---

## Step 1.1 – Load dataset

## Step 1.2 – Basic EDA

* shape
* nulls
* data types
* summary statistics

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 1 – Raw data explored`

---

## Step 1.3 – Target creation

Good vs bad → PD model.

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 2 – Target created`

---

## Step 1.4 – Feature engineering

This is where your project becomes elite.

We already started:

* Age buckets
* Credit log
* Duration bins
* Loan-to-income proxy
* Risk segmentation

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 3 – Feature engineering`

---

## Step 1.5 – Encoding

Dummy + safe encoding.

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 4 – Encoding done`

---

## Step 1.6 – Save clean dataset

This prevents memory loss.

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 5 – Clean dataset saved`

---

---

# 🚀 PHASE 2 – MODEL BUILDING (PD MODEL)

Notebook:

```
02_PD_model.ipynb
```

---

## Step 2.1 – Load clean data

## Step 2.2 – Train-test split

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 6 – Data split`

---

## Step 2.3 – Scaling

(StandardScaler)

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 7 – Scaling`

---

## Step 2.4 – Class imbalance

This is where most freshers fail.

* Class weights
* SMOTE comparison
* Why imbalance matters in credit risk

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 8 – Imbalance handled`

---

## Step 2.5 – Logistic Regression

Industry gold standard.

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 9 – Baseline model`

---

## Step 2.6 – Model evaluation

* ROC AUC
* Precision
* Recall
* Confusion matrix
* KS score

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 10 – Model evaluated`

---

---

# 🚀 PHASE 3 – MODEL IMPROVEMENT

---

## Step 3.1 – Hyperparameter tuning

## Step 3.2 – Compare models

* Logistic
* Random forest
* XGBoost

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 11 – Models compared`

---

## Step 3.3 – Final model selection

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 12 – Final model`

---

---

# 🚀 PHASE 4 – RISK & BUSINESS LAYER

This is where you become different from 99% of candidates.

Notebook:

```
03_business_risk_layer.ipynb
```

---

## Step 4.1 – Risk segmentation

* Low
* Medium
* High
* Reject

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 13 – Risk bands`

---

## Step 4.2 – Cutoff strategy

Loan approval rules.

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 14 – Cutoff policy`

---

## Step 4.3 – Expected loss calculation

PD × LGD × EAD.

This connects to FRM.

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 15 – Expected loss`

---

## Step 4.4 – Portfolio simulation

* Profit vs risk
* What happens if bank tightens rules

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 16 – Portfolio simulation`

---

---

# 🚀 PHASE 5 – MODEL EXPLAINABILITY

This is elite-level and MBA-ready.

Notebook:

```
04_explainability.ipynb
```

---

## Step 5.1 – Feature importance

## Step 5.2 – SHAP values

## Step 5.3 – Key drivers of default

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 17 – Explainability`

---

---

# 🚀 PHASE 6 – SQL (BANKING LEVEL)

This is where your profile becomes **rare**.

---

## Step 6.1 – Load clean dataset into SQL

(MySQL or PostgreSQL)

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 18 – Data in SQL`

---

## Step 6.2 – Portfolio analysis

Examples:

* Default rate by age
* Default by job
* Default by income proxy

Checkpoint:
👉 `Checkpoint 19 – SQL risk analysis`

---

## Step 6.3 – Monitoring dashboards
